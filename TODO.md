 - implement a `maxvals` so that it gives u a resonable amount of data if you ask for too much
 - add streaming capabilities, will have to tie it to a fake python generator
 - figure out the difference between frame and sample lol
 - add option for X axis, defaults to TIME, idk why one would not want time but whatever...
