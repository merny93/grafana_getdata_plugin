- add streaming capabilities:
    - figure out how a backend plugin sends a stream (send Channel field or smthing)
    - extend the datasource object
    - figure out how the backend knows when to push new data. Should it be tied to one of the news servers?
    - ~~will have to tie it to a fake python generator~~
- Options to do time lookup by index:
    - checkox to switch to index
    - set datarate
    - set end condition (now minus time or something, still want to use grafana default time options)
- Smarter memory allocation for gd_getdata. Currently making a dummy call with `restype = void` to figure out how much data to allocate before actually calling the function 
- improve thread-lock. Unclear what will happen when it is running as an actual server...
- Build tools: Get it to work with mage (or write a sciprt that generates all the needed binaries to call it a actual plugin)
- ~~add real error handling using gd_error(*DIRFILE)~~
- ~~Helpful field lookup~~
    - ~~Drop down with suggestions on field when looking up a field~~
    - ~~Support regex as kst does~~
- ~~implement a `maxvals` so that it gives u a resonable amount of data if you ask for too much~~
- ~~add option for X axis, defaults to TIME, idk why one would not want time but whatever...~~
