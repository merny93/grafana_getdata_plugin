- ~~add streaming capabilities:~~
    - ~~add ability to stream with arbitrary x axis~~
    - ~~Some weirdness with streaming multiple endpoints at the same time, somehow I managed to instantiate two identical endpoints... might have fixed~~ I think I fixed it
    - ~~Calls to RunStream do not seem to ever terminate even when the subscribers disconnect~~ It was resource dependant, when push comes to shove it happens
    - Make the time field variable, currently hardcoded x axis field as TIME, either pass it along from the request or encode in the endpoint
    - ~~bug: the max points is used as a buffer and streaming at full resolution easily overfills it deleting old data points. In addition the data is cached which means that a soft refresh does not solve the problem. Desired behavior is to first fetch historical data and then fill with streamed data. If overfilled decimate instead of deleting old data: [maybe relevant github issue](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/43286)~~ fixed by following the example from [mqtt-datasource-plugin](https://github.com/grafana/mqtt-datasource/blob/main/pkg/plugin/stream.go)
    - ~~figure out how a backend plugin sends a stream (send Channel field or smthing)~~
    - ~~extend the datasource object~~
    - ~~figure out how the backend knows when to push new data. Should it be tied to one of the news servers?~~ Checking nframes and sending when it increases
    - ~~figureout the runstream method~~
    - ~~will have to tie it to a fake python generator~~
- ~~Options to do time lookup by index:~~
    - ~~checkox to switch to index~~
    - ~~set datarate~~
    - ~~set end condition (now minus time or something, still want to use grafana default time options)~~
- Smarter memory allocation for gd_getdata. Currently making a dummy call with `restype = void` to figure out how much data to allocate before actually calling the function 
- improve thread-lock. Unclear what will happen when it is running as an actual server...
- Build tools: Get it to work with mage (or write a sciprt that generates all the needed binaries to call it a actual plugin)
- ~~add real error handling using gd_error(*DIRFILE)~~
- ~~Helpful field lookup~~
    - ~~Drop down with suggestions on field when looking up a field~~
    - ~~Support regex as kst does~~
- ~~implement a `maxvals` so that it gives u a resonable amount of data if you ask for too much~~
- ~~add option for X axis, defaults to TIME, idk why one would not want time but whatever...~~
