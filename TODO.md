- add streaming capabilities:
    - figure out how a backend plugin sends a stream (send Channel field or smthing)
    - extend the datasource object
    - figure out how the backend knows when to push new data. Should it be tied to one of the news servers?
    - ~~ will have to tie it to a fake python generator ~~
- Options to do time lookup by index:
    - checkox to switch to index
    - set datarate
    - set end condition (now minus time or something, still want to use grafana default time options)
- add real error handling using gd_error(*DIRFILE)
- improve thread-lock. Unclear what will happen when it is running as an actual server...
- ~~ implement a `maxvals` so that it gives u a resonable amount of data if you ask for too much ~~\
- ~~ add option for X axis, defaults to TIME, idk why one would not want time but whatever... ~~
- ~~ figure out the difference between frame and sample lol ~~
